Go to http://php.t10.tech.dmu.ac.uk:6789/p07224405/index.php and follow the directions.
You will be asked to register before you can continue.
Once registered/logged in you will be able to see the remote status by clicking
 the appropriate link in the menu system at the top.
Should all be fairly self explanatory.

When registering the phone number you are asked for is the number of the board/mobile
 that will sending smses to the M2M Server.

When viewing the Remote Status page, clicking the email button will send the status
 of that line in an email (provided there is an email server, which last time
 I checked there was not) to the address you registered with.
